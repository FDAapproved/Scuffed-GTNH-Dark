# GTNH Dark
Darker yet darker... 

A GT New Horizons: Dark theme for 2.7.X.

## Recommended Resource Packs
Despite being developed with certain accompanying resource packs in mind; this GUI overhaul can be ran alone. I use:

- [Unity](https://github.com/Unity-Resource-Pack/Unity/tree/1.7.10),
- [Unity - IC2 Backport](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/unity-ic2-1-7-10-backport),
- [Draconic Evolution 16x16 Redux](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/draconic-evolution-16x16-redux),
- and [Wily's GTNH Resource Pack](https://github.com/Wilyb/Wily-bit-s-GTNH-tex),

if you want pairing suggestions. [Zedtech: New-Horizons](https://github.com/FyreofShadow/zedtech-new-horizons) also looks nice, but has overlap with Wily's pack, which you'd likely have to resolve on your own (as do Unity and Wily's).
